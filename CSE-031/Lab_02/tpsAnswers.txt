			TPS 3

1. 4 variables were declared in the first line of 
   main program. 2 of them are pointers ( *px, *py).

2. I expected x,y, and the array to be filled with random junk numbers, 
   but instead x was 0, y was 1, first 8 values of the integer array were 0s, 
   and last two were big junk numbers. When I repeatedly run the program, 
   only the 9th value in the array changes.

3. You assign them values.

4. printf("Adress of x is: %p Value of x is: %d", (void*)&x, x);
   printf("\nAdress of y is: %p Value of y is: %d", (void*)&y, y);

5. px = &x;
   py = &y;

6. *arr give value arr points to and arr = arr + 1 moves arr pointer to the next value in arr
7. mv function can rename an executable file ("mv main cselab1")
8. It creates an a.out executable file
9. ./nameOfTheFile command
