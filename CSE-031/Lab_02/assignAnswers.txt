            Individual Assignment 1

1.  Line 18 caused segmentation fault. 
2.  You add a "&" simbol before the input.
3. Sum is being assigned to zero initially 
   and since it is not being passed by reference 
   to the read_values function, its value never changes.
4. Pass sum by reference(or pointer)


            Individual Assignment 2
        
1. The output is expected. The first string gets appended 
   to the second string resulting in "HELLO!hello!".
2. The output is NOT expected. It was supposed to be "HI!hi!"
    but instead it is "HI!hi!hello!". The problem is in the way new
    user input is being read and in the way append functions
    appends the two strings. After you put first set of strings in,
    str2 is just being added to the empty slots of str1. However,
    str1 doesnt get emptied. So part of that first input stays in str1 
    when the next input is being taken, which messes up the second print.
3. The output is UNexpected. It prints " thank you!I am fine, thank you!�o�"
    because the strings are initialized to only 10 character length.
    However, each of the strings inputed is longer than 10 characters.
