A. Labor Force: 97million + 3million + 5million =  105 
B. LFPR: 105/125 * 100 = 84%
C. The actual real output is greater than the potential real output because the actual rate of unemployment is 1% lower than the natural rate of unemployment, meaning that the economy is beyond what is considered full employment.
D. Natural rate of unemployment includes structural and frictional unemployment, but actual rate of unemployment includes all three types (structural, frictional, and cyclical). So cyclical rate of unemployment would equal to 5% - 4% = 1%
E. The actual rate of unemployment will remain the same because discourage workers did not count as unemployed workers.
